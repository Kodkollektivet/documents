### Infrastructure

We use Discord Nitro subscription for Kodstugan. We'll have CodeHubs/events in the future. 

Should we continue paying for Nitro?
Marcus will cancel the subsription and we will vote next meeting. 


### CodeHub

* John's codehub -  online

Jordan will post the FB event tomorrow

Its on redux

If not that many people are interested in coming to the event then we might consider pausing the codehubs further. On the other hand this alienates our members more.

It will be online
