### VSP

Silvia had a meeting with us.
ITG/KK held workshops for/with VSP. They give us access to the innovation lab. 

They wonder how, who and if we will continue the cooperation. 

They want to continue the activities.

Companies can come and have team building activity, potentially something we can help out with. 

If and when we decide to continue Codehubs, Silvia wants to know. 

### Events

* Microbits

### Relationship between KK & ITG

ITG might become an employer.
ITG could then pay salaries. For example for students who host the workshops. 

### Other

Can we host introduction week again? 

Talk to Laure and say we might be able to host workshop. But can we get paid?
