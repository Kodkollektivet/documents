### Approval of the Agenda

Agenda was approved

### Main issue
Daniel Ekerot and collaboration with Sigma

Perhaps develop an application in cooperation with Sigma, as a way to have students learn to develop applications with the help of professional developers. Daniel says this is not meant to be any sort of recruitment attempt. He would like to meet with us sometime to talk about the idea.

Johan will ask Daniel for times that he would be available to meet and talk about it. If there is no good time to meet, Johan will ask him questions on behalf of the board.

### CodeHub

Next codehub will be on the 12th of January. It will still be digital. Ali will ask John about potentially do this codehub.

Johan has a potential speaker from Truesec, Max Kardos. He works with Cybersecurity. He will not be able to a codehub before around the end of January. Johan will check in with him.


### Online Activities

We're not currently spending anything on Code Hubs, so we can maybe do some online events with prizes instead.

The board agrees it is a good idea, and needs to come up with competition ideas. The board also generally agrees that we should occasionally do polls of some kind in discord to keep the server active.

* Small programming Competitions with prizes
    - A teacher(s) in Juri
    - a nerd's prize

* Interactions and pools to keep discord alive 
    - favorite books?
    - favorite languages?
    - favorite tools ?

### Online tutoring

First impression, result, statistics and future improvement

Only one person came but stayed for the entire time. May be more popular when the students begin working with Java.
