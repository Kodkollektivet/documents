# Values and Goals for Kodkollektivet, 2019-2020

## Louise
### Goals & Vision
- Kodkollektivet should be a open space for ideas and cooperation between members
 - To acheive this it is important that the members feel welcome
 - That there is a venue for discussion 
 - The office has been good with this but maybe also the university can be a good place, if when we go back we figure out how to make a lecture hall more OK to make discussions happen.
 - The board has an obligation to "blow wind in the sails" of the ideas of the members
 - To be positive towards ideas
 - To maybe feel the waters with companies/the university, if there can be sponsorship or other possibilities to make the ideas realisable
 - Kodkollektivet should be a link between the trade and industry(n√§ringslivet), and the students at LNU.
 - Companies are approached to give talks about topics students are interested in
 - Companies are approached to invite students to them (like softwerk invited the board), to network and establish a connection between business and studies.
 - For this to be successful maybe we'd have to adjust the amount of people showing up?
 - And also have a clear agenda of what the companies are to do when they invite us, so that it does not turn into only a work-for-us-sales pitch
 - Kodkollektivet should actively seek out opportunities to give to their members for example through close cooperation with the university, with the student union and with other student organisations
